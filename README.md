This is a test
For this project I will be the only team member. Due to my schedule I cannot reliably work with others and their schedules, so in order to avoid letting my team mates down I decided to work alone. I am currently planning on implimenting a linked list system in some way. My best example would be to use a linked list to show how mail was tranfered cross country during the 1800's. Each town would be a node and would have a distance between it and the next town. I could also use graphs for this, but I am more comfortable with linked lists and I beleive that I can acheive the goals I want with linked lists. I can use this system to show mail delivery across the country and showing the total distance traveled.
